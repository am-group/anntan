              <b>The egg freezing process</b><br />
              Called oocyte cryopreservation, egg freezing<sup>1</sup> allows women to freeze and store their eggs until
              the time that they wish to start or expand their families.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Baseline test</b><br />
              This test is done a day or two after the onset of menses. This typically includes an ultrasound and a
              blood test. For those with irregular menses, a cycle of oral contraceptive pills may be used to regulate
              the menses before starting ovarian stimulation. For those with regular cycles, this may not be
              necessary.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ovarian stimulation</b><br />
              Hormonal injections are given daily over 10 to 12 days to stimulate the ovaries and ripen multiple eggs.
              To monitor the eggs, regular timed clinic visits involving ultrasounds and blood tests are done to look
              for mature eggs.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Egg Retrieval</b><br />
              When tests indicate that the eggs are approaching maturity, a trigger to simulate the LH surge is given
              and the eggs are then removed via a needle placed through the posterior vaginal vault. Once the eggs are
              removed, they are then immediately frozen.<br />
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="footnote">
            <li><sup>1</sup> Egg freezing is currently only allowed for cancer patients and those with specific medical
              disorders. However you can obtain information if you wish to have social egg freezing at reputable

                <p>
                  Dr Ann Tan is one of the few obstetricians and gynaecologists who is trained and accredited in both
                  fetal
                  medicine and reproductive medicine. Over the past two decades, she has been caring for both local and
                  expatriate communities as well as women of all ages.
                  <br><br>
                  A Public Service Commission (PSC) Scholar, Dr Tan has been the recipient of several prestigious awards
                  including the HMDP Scholarship for Fetal Echocardiography at the Yale School of Medicine, the Young
                  Investigator Award by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynaecology, and the
                  Young
                  Investigator Award at the Hong Kong Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists International
                  Scientific Meeting. 
                  <br><br>
                    Dr Tan is also the first Singaporean gynaecologist to hold the Diploma of Fetal Medicine from the
                    Fetal Medicine Foundation. She is a dedicated OBGYN in the field of prenatal diagnosis and care of
                    both mother and fetus. Notably, she introduced the First Trimester Pregnancy Screen or OSCAR into
                    Singapore in 2003 to give women the chance to screen their pregnancies earlier.
                    <br><br>
                    Most recently, she is now serving as the Medical Director of Virtus Fertility Centre, Singapore, and
                    is looking forward to bringing her wealth of experience to the established Centre.

                    <strong class="small-title">Guiding Philosophy </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Dr Tan believes that couples should be empowered with knowledge, and fertility should be
                    approached as a purposeful journey, one to be well-prepared for. She has a holistic approach to
                    fertility and stresses the importance of adopting good lifestyle habits and of having healthy
                    parents-to-be.
                    <br><br>
                    Led by her strong passion for women’s health, she continues to invest her time in serving at the
                    Women’s Health Committee under the Health Promotion Board as well as the Families for Life
                    Council.

                    <br><br>
                    Clinical work aside, Dr Tan is actively involved in social organizations as well. She is a Past
                    President of Singapore’s Council of Women’s Organisations where she sought to address women’s
                    diverse needs. Subsequently, she was awarded the Public Service Medal for her efforts in the SCWO.
                    <br><br>
                    As a strong voice for education and empowerment in Singapore, Dr Tan also serves on the board of
                    Halogen Foundation, an IPC charity that supports youth engagement through leadership training and
                    equipping youth with the skills needed to become entrepreneurs.
                    <br><br>
                    An advocate for open discussion and public education on fertility, Dr Tan regularly contributes to
                    health programmes and talk shows, where she shares her insight on fertility and pregnancy issues.

                  Egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation is a process where a woman’s eggs are extracted and frozen for
                  keeping. It is not meant to encourage delayed parenthood but rather as a protection against
                  childlessness. For women with a family history of premature menopause, saving one’s fertility
                  potential may be critical for her to have her own genetically similar children. Egg freezing is also a
                  useful adjunct for those undergoing <a href="https://www.anntan.com.sg/ivf.html" title="IVF"
                    style="color:#c01f39">IVF</a>, as it allows couples – who for personal or religious reasons – choose
                  not to place extra embryos in cold storage and feel more comfortable storing the extra eggs
                  instead.<br />
                  <br />
                  In Singapore, egg freezing is only available in the context of those suffering from cancer and
                  desiring to store their eggs before undergoing chemotherapy (Sperm freezing has been in place for many
                  years.)

                  Younger is better when it comes to storing eggs and sperms. It must be remembered that frozen eggs
                  from a 40 year old have only a 10% chance of success. An IVF cycle at age 42 with frozen eggs
                  retrieved at 38 years is more likely to succeed than a fresh cycle at 42 years. To be effective,
                  therefore, egg freezing is best carried out from age 35 or younger.
